# NBA 2022-2023 Season
A project looking at the NBA 2022-2023 regular season. For a more personal read into my journey with the project read the [Project_Journal.md](https://github.com/adeoyethomas/NBA_2022-2023/blob/main/Project_Journal.md) file.

## Task
The initial aim of the task was to extract, organise and store data on the PPG for an NBA team from an API and analyse this data to see how it affected a teams finishing position during the regular season. The aim has developed since then.

## Tech Stack (this may change)
* Python
* Visual Studio Code
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Cloud
* BigQuery & Snowflake (*Either of the tools can do the job but I will do the same thing using both for practice purposes*)
* Power Bi & Tableau (*Either of the tools can do the job but I will do the same thing using both for practice purposes*)
