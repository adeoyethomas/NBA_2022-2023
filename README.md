# NBA 2022-2023 Season
A personal project looking at the NBA 2022-2023 regular season

## Task
This task is still a work in progress and the overall plan may change so I will keep this file up to date with any changes.

<ins>8th Aug 2023</ins>
The plan is to collate and store data from the 2022-2023 season such as a team's regular season finish position, Points Per Game (PPG) conceded & PPG scored using this [RESTful API for basketball data](https://www.api-basketball.com/). I will use Google Cloud Platform to store the data (most likely using a bucket on cloud storage) and then use UDF to transfer the data to BigQuery where I will do some analysis, then produce some visualizations using Tableau or PowerBi.

## Tech Stack (this may change)
* Python
* MySQL
* Google Cloud
* BigQuery
* Power Bi or Tableau
